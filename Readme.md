#  EasierAboutBoxMac

SwiftUI examples I've found make use of AppDelegates. 

In trying to figure out how to place the About Box on the screen, I found an easier way. 

Add a WindowGroup for the About Box. 

This project is a bare-bones example. 

Select "About !" under the app menu, and the about box will be presented.

Apple's WindowGroup documentation can be found [here](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/swiftui/windowgroup).

It's likely this same idea will work for help pages.
